1.8 (2016-08-19)
================

 - Switched to Gist instead of Dpaste.
 - Added functionality allowing one to specify their own Paste backend.

1.7 (2015-01-28)
================

 - Added 'activation_timeout' timer that defines a time limit for the first
   interaction with the IRC channel before disconnecting and continuing
   execution.

1.6 (2014-12-20)
================

 - Adds a django template tag {% set_trace %}; this is usable for opening
   up an ircpdb channel during template parsing.

1.5 (2014-12-04)
================

 - Adds functionality for specifying configuration parameters via a single
   argument containing a URI.  Rather than specifying potentially a dozen
   separate parameters, one can now provide a single string; for example:
   "irc+ssl://bot@chat.freenode.net:6667/#mychannel?limit_access_to=me".
 - Adds ability to specify default configuration parameters via environment
   variable named 'DEFAULT_IRCPDB_URI'.

1.4 (2014-11-11)
================

 - Simpler internal handling of prompt.
 - Adding internal support for IRC CTCP commands.
 - Pinning jaraco/irc library version at 0.9 to preserve Python 2.6 support.

1.3 (2014-11-01)
================

 - Reduced security concerns by making it impossible to configure the
   debugger to respond to all usernames.
 - Fixed a UI glitch in which the prompt would be displayed in inappropriate
   situations.

1.2 (2014-10-31)
================

 - Many UI improvements including:
   - Display a prompt after the response has been written.
 - Added '!!forbid' command.
 - Added a thunderous warning to the readme about the security implications
   of this library.

1.1 (2014-10-30)
================

 - Added functionality for automatically sending long messages to Dpaste.
 - Added additional commands including `!!set_dpaste_minimum_response_length`
   and `!!set_message_wait_seconds`.
 - Send a hello message once connected to the channel.

1.0 (2014-10-29)
==================

 - Forked from rpdb to, instead of opening a socket to interact with,
   opening a connection to an IRC channel.
