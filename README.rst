Ircpdb is an adaptation of rpdb that, instead of opening a port and
allowing you to debug over telnet, connects to a configurable IRC
channel so you can collaboratively debug an application remotely.

.. code-block::

    import ircpdb
    ircpdb.set_trace(
        channel="#debugger_hangout",
        limit_access_to=['mynickname'], # List of nicknames that are allowed access
    )

By default, ircpdb will select a nickname on its own and enter the channel
you specify on Freenode, but you can feel free to configure ircpdb to
connect anywhere:

.. code-block::

    import ircpdb
    ircpdb.set_trace(
        channel="#debugger_hangout",
        nickname='im_a_debugger',
        server='irc.mycompany.org',
        limit_access_to=['mynickname', 'someothernickname', 'mybestfriend'],
        port=6667,
        ssl=True,
    )  # See 'Options' below for descriptions of the above arguments

Upon reaching ``set_trace()``, your script will "hang" and the only way to get
it to continue is to access ircpdb by talking to the user that connected to the
above IRC channel.

By default, the debugger will enter the channel you've specified using a
username starting with the hostname of the computer from which it was
launched (in the following example: 'MyHostname').  To interact with
the debugger, just send messages in the channel prefixed with "MyHostname:",
or simply "!".

For example, the following two commands are equivalent, and each will
display the pdb help screen (be sure to replace 'MyHostname' with whatever
username the bot selected)::

    !help

::

    MyHostname: help

Installation
------------

From ``pip``::

    pip install ircpdb

Options
-------

You can either specify the server to connect to using a series of keyword
arguments, or using a single URI string described below in `URI Format`.
If you happen to specify connection parameters using both a URI and
keyword arguments, the keyword arguments will take priority.

* ``uri``: A 'URI' specifying the IRC server and channel to connect to.  If you
  specify a URI, there is no need to specify the below parameters, but if you
  do specify any other parameters, they will override settings specified in the URI.
  See `URI Format` below for more information.
* ``channel`` (**REQUIRED IF NOT USING URI**): The name of the channel (starting with ``#``)
  to connect to on the IRC server.
* ``limit_access_to`` (**REQUIRED IF NOT USING URI**): A list of nicknames that
  are allowed to interact with the debugger.  When specified in a URI, this should
  be a comma-separated list of nicknames.
* ``nickname``: The nickname to use when connecting. Note that an alternate
  name will be selected if this name is already in use. Defaults to using
  the hostname of the machine on which the debugger was executed.
* ``server``: The hostname or IP address of the IRC server.
  Default: ``chat.freenode.net``.
* ``port``: The port number of the IRC server.  Default: ``6697``.
* ``ssl``: Use SSL when connecting to the IRC server?  Default: ``True``.
* ``password``: The server password (if necessary) for the IRC server.
  Default: ``None``.
* ``message_wait_seconds``: The number of seconds that the bot should
  wait between sending messages on IRC.  Many servers, including Freenode,
  will kick clients that send too many messages in too short of a time
  frame.  Default: ``0.8`` seconds.
* ``dpaste_minimum_response_length``: Try to post messages this length
  or longer to `dpaste <http://dpaste.com/>`_ rather than sending
  each line individually via IRC.  This is a useful parameter to use
  if you happen to be connected to a server having very austere
  limits on the number of lines a client can send per minute.
  Default: ``10`` lines.
* ``activation_timeout``: Wait maximally this number of seconds for
  somebody to interact with the debugger in the channel before
  disconnecting and continuing execution.  Default: ``60`` seconds.

Default Settings via Environment Variable
-----------------------------------------

You can specify default connection parameters by setting the ``DEFAULT_IRCPDB_URI``
environment variable with a URI matching the format described below in `URI Format`.

URI Format
----------

Example::

    irc+ssl://botnickname@ircserverhostname:6667/#mychannel?limit_access_to=mynickname

This is a shortcut format to use for specifying IRC connection parameters; roughly
this follows the following format::

    irc[+<ssl?>]://[[<nickname>][:<password>]@]<hostname>[:<port>]/<channel>

All other parameters mentioned in `Options` above can be specified as query string arguments.

Note that this diverges from a standard URI in that you should include the ``#``
characters at the beginning of your channel name **unescaped**.

Use in Django Templates
-----------------------

In your `settings.py`, add `ircpbd.django` to your installed apps::

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        # Other apps
        # ...
        'ircpdb.django',
    ]

Within the template you'd like to add a debugger trace to, load the
`ircpdb` template tags by adding the following to the top of the template::

    {% load ircpdb %}

And, where you'd like to inject the ircpdb trace::

    {% set_trace channel='#my_channel' limit_access_to='coddingtonbear' %}

.. note::

   Although most parameters are unchanged between when invoking ``set_trace``
   in python and invoking ``set_trace`` from within a template, the parameter
   ``limit_access_to`` should be a comma-separated list of usernames rather
   than a list literal when using ``set_trace`` in a template (like above).

Next time you render this template (probably by going to a view that
uses it), rendering will be halted at the point where you've placed your trace,
and the ircpdb bot will appear in your channel.

Security Disclaimer
-------------------

The way that this library works is **inherently** **dangerous**; given that
you're able to execute arbitrary Python code from within your debugger,
it is strongly recommended that you take all reasonable measures to ensure
that you control who are able to execute debugger commands.

To limit your risk as much as possible, you should consider taking the
following steps:

* Always use an SSL-capable IRC server (read: leave the ``ssl`` argument
  set to it's default: ``True``).
* Connect to an IRC server you or a company you work for owns rather than
  Freenode (the default).

Just to make absolutely sure this is clear: you're both responsible for
determining what level of risk you are comfortable with, and for taking
appropriate actions to mitigate that risk.

Good luck, and happy debugging!

Troubleshooting
---------------

If you do not see the bot entering your specified channel, try increasing
the logging level by adding the following lines above your trace to gather
a little more information about problems that may have occurred while 
connecting to the IRC server:

.. code-block::

   import logging
   logging.basicConfig(filename='/path/to/somewhere.log', level=logging.DEBUG)
