ircpdb - Remotely and collaboratively debug your Python application via IRC
===========================================================================

Ircpdb is an adaptation of rpdb that, instead of opening a port and
allowing you to debug over telnet, connects to a configurable IRC
channel so you can collaboratively debug an application remotely.

.. code-block::

    import ircpdb
    ircpdb.set_trace(
        channel="#debugger_hangout",
    )

By default, ircpdb will create the channel you specify on Freenode
and randomly select a nickname for itself, but you can feel free to
configure ircpdb to connect anywhere:

.. code-block::

    import ircpdb
    ircpdb.set_trace(
        channel="#debugger_hangout",
        nickname='im_a_debugger',
        server='irc.mycompany.org',
        limit_access_to=['mynickname'],
        port=6667,
        ssl=True,
    )  # See 'Options' below for descriptions of the above arguments

Upon reaching `set_trace()`, your script will "hang" and the only way to get it
to continue is to access ircpdb by talking to the user that connected to the
above IRC channel.

By default, the debugger will enter the channel you've specified using a
username starting with the hostname of the computer from which it was
launched (in the following example: 'MyHostname').  To interact with
the debugger, just send messages in the channel prefixed with "MyHostname:",
or simply "!".

For example, the following two commands are equivalent, and each will
display the pdb help screen (be sure to replace 'MyHostname' with whatever
username the bot selected)::

    !help

::

    MyHostname: help

Options
-------

* ``channel`` (**REQUIRED**): The name of the channel (starting with ``#``)
  to connect to on the IRC server.
* ``nickname``: The nickname to use when connecting. Note that an alternate
  name will be selected if this name is already in use. Defaults to using
  the hostname of the machine on which the debugger was executed.
* ``server``: The hostname or IP address of the IRC server.
  Default: `chat.freenode.net`.
* ``port``: The port number of the IRC server.  Default: `6697`.
* ``ssl``: Use SSL when connecting to the IRC server?  Default: `True`.
* ``password``: The server password (if necessary) for the IRC server.
  Default: `None`.
* ``limit_access_to``: A list of nicknames that are allowed to interact
  with the debugger.  An empty list allows all nicknames to access the
  debugger.  Default: `[]`.
* ``message_wait_seconds``: The number of seconds that the bot should
  wait between sending messages on IRC.  Many servers, including Freenode,
  will kick clients that send too many messages in too short of a time
  frame.  Default: `0.8` seconds.
* ``dpaste_minimum_response_length``: Try to post messages this length
  or longer to `dpaste <http://dpaste.com/>`_ rather than sending
  each line individually via IRC.  This is a useful parameter to use
  if you happen to be connected to a server having very austere
  limits on the number of lines a client can send per minute.
  Default: `10` lines.

Installation
------------

From ``pip``::

    pip install ircpdb

Troubleshooting
---------------

If you do not see the bot entering your specified channel, try increasing
the logging level by adding the following lines above your trace to gather
a little more information about problems that may have occurred while 
connecting to the IRC server:

.. code-block::

   import logging
   logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
